# Zabbix AI Assistant

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always test Zabbix modules in a non-production or staging environment before deploying them in a live production setting. Running scripts directly in production without prior testing can lead to unintended consequences, such as system downtime, data loss, or configuration issues. Testing helps ensure that the script behaves as expected, is compatible with your systems, and performs the required tasks without causing disruptions.
>
> **Best Practice:**
> - **Test in a safe environment:** Use a dedicated test machine or sandbox environment to verify the scriptâ€™s functionality.
> - **Review logs and output:** Check for any errors, warnings, or unexpected behavior during testing.
> - **Monitor the impact:** After the test, assess the script's impact on system performance, services, and configuration settings.
> 
> By following this approach, you can minimize risks and ensure smooth execution in production environments.
